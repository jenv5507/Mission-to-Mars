# Mission to Mars

The purpose of this repository is to help those who are interested to have a one stop for Mars Facts and the latest Mars News.  The facts compare Mars to Earth and state basic information such as the distance from the sun, diameter and temperature.

In addition to the latest Mars news, I have also include the Mars Hemisphere images and the name of each.

I hope you enjoy the information provided on Mars news and plan on adding additional information in the near future.
